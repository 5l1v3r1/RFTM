<p>Unless you hold an <a href="http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/radiocommunication-licences/amateur-radio/">Amateur Radio license</a> or have had specific training about UK law with respect to the areas of the radio frequency spectrum and at what power levels you are allowed to transmit, it is highly recommended that you restrict yourself to only receiving. The amateur radio license is fairly easy to get and a few people in the company seem to have them. Try emailing DL-Tech and you may find someone local who is willing to lend you training materials or point you in the direction of a local club.</p>

<p>A high level overview of UK law with respect to radio transmitters can be found <a href="http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/spectrum-enforcement/law">here</a></p>

<p>If you need to transmit signals on bands for which it would normally be illegal to do so e.g. Broadcast radio or 3G cellular then this can be performed within an RF-shielded environment. These come in all shapes and sizes, from small:</p>

<p>Another approach is to directly connect your transmitter to your receiver via a cable so that no radio waves are transmitted. However, in order to do this without damaging the receiver you need to use in-line attenuators (see below) to reduce the signal level, as would occur if it was transmitted via an antenna</p>
