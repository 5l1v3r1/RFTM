{"name":"RFTM","tagline":"","body":"The RFTM is an Open Source, collaborative testing methodology that can be applied to all Radio Frequency (wireless) technologies. Throughout this methodology, we'll use various real-world wireless protocol examples\r\n\r\n[Signals and Modulation](basics.html)\r\n\r\n[Information Sources](information_sources.html)\r\n\r\n[Receiving Signals](receiving_signals.html)\r\n\r\n[Developing an FSK receiver step-by-step](fsk_receiver.html)\r\n\r\n[Developing an ASK receiver step-by-step](ask_receiver.html)\r\n\r\n[Transmitting Data](transmitting_data.html)\r\n\r\n[Developing an FSK transmitter step-by-step](fsk_transmitter.html)\r\n\r\nSignals identification\r\n======================\r\n\r\nIn order to correctly demodulate a received signal you need to be able to identify it first. This section will provide some guidance around identifying common signals.\r\n\r\nThis [website](http://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide) is a good place to start.\r\n\r\nAmplitude Shift Keying (ASK)\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe below example is the most simple form of ASK, known as On-Off Keying (OOK):\r\n\r\n![](images/ask_baudline.png)\r\n\r\nFrequency Shift Keying (FSK)\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe below example is the most simple form of FSK, known as 2-FSK or Binary FSK:\r\n\r\n![](images/fsk_baudline.png)\r\n\r\nTODO - add more stuff here\r\n\r\nLegal considerations\r\n====================\r\n\r\nUnless you hold an [Amateur Radio license](http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/radiocommunication-licences/amateur-radio/) or have had specific training about UK law with respect to the areas of the radio frequency spectrum and at what power levels you are allowed to transmit, it is highly recommended that you restrict yourself to only receiving. The amateur radio license is fairly easy to get and a few people in the company seem to have them. Try emailing DL-Tech and you may find someone local who is willing to lend you training materials or point you in the direction of a local club.\r\n\r\nA high level overview of UK law with respect to radio transmitters can be found [here](http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/spectrum-enforcement/law)\r\n\r\nExample flow-graphs and tutorials\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nSimple FM radio receiver\r\n------------------------\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
