{"name":"RF Testing Methodology","tagline":"www.nccgroup.com","body":"\r\nThe RFTM is an Open Source, collaborative testing methodology. It is specifically written in a straightforward way, avoiding mathematics where possible and focussed on providing the information that security researchers and consultants need to know in order to effectively test systems that employ RF technologies. Throughout this methodology, we'll use various real-world RF protocol examples.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute to the RFTM content, please submit your additions via [GitHub](https://github.com/nccgroup/RFTM).\r\n\r\n[Signals and Modulation](basics.html)\r\n\r\n[Information Sources](information_sources.html)\r\n\r\n[Receiving Signals](receiving_signals.html)\r\n\r\n[Developing an FSK receiver step-by-step](fsk_receiver.html)\r\n\r\n[Developing an ASK receiver step-by-step](ask_receiver.html)\r\n\r\n[Transmitting Data](transmitting_data.html)\r\n\r\n[Developing an FSK transmitter step-by-step](fsk_transmitter.html)\r\n\r\n[Signals identification](signals_identification.html)\r\n\r\n[Examples and Tutorials](examples_and_tutorials.html)\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Michael Ossmann of [Great Scott Gadgets](www.greatscottgadgets.com) for developing the [HackRF](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) and providing some excellent talks and tutorials which inspired the creation of the RFTM","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
